Hypersign is a cryptographic security and identity solution that enables users to access (Web, Federated and Decentralized) applications with a singular identity without providing their credentials.

The protocol validates a digital signature produced by a standard  blockchain algorithm - ECDSA, in a mobile device using authentication service which is a smart-contract deployed on a blockchain and does not rely on central authority and hence providing a complete decentralised environment for identity management.
